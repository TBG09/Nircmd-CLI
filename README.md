# Nircmd-CLI
As far as I know, Nircmd doesn't have a command line. So I made one. If you are redistributing this. Provide credit, please.
This is made for easy use for the nircmd.exe file.
And also, I added 2 extra commands.
help - opens the help file for nircmd
cd - works the same as regular cd

And make sure to download nircmd using one of the download files. Use the correct one either x32 or x64. (Just note, it takes a few to download. Feel free to make optimizations!)
You can even add this to Windows Terminal as a Profile. Just make the profile icon Icon\nirsoft.ico
